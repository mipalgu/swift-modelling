// MARK: - EObject Protocol

/// Base protocol for all Ecore model elements.
///
/// `EObject` is the root of the Ecore metamodel hierarchy. All model elements
/// (both metamodel definitions and model instances) conform to this protocol.
///
/// ## Key Capabilities
///
/// - **Reflective Access**: Features can be accessed dynamically via ``eGet(_:)`` and ``eSet(_:_:)``
/// - **Identity**: Every object has a unique identifier via `Identifiable`
/// - **Value Semantics**: Thread-safe through `Sendable` and value comparison via `Hashable`
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Types conforming to `EObject` must implement the reflective API to allow
/// dynamic access to their structural features (attributes and references).
public protocol EObject: EcoreValue {
    /// The type of classifier (metaclass) for this object.
    ///
    /// This associated type allows each `EObject` to specify its own classifier type,
    /// providing type safety whilst maintaining flexibility.
    associatedtype Classifier: EClassifier

    /// The identifier type (must be EUUID).
    ///
    /// All Ecore objects use `EUUID` for identity.
    associatedtype ID = EUUID

    /// Identity-based equality uses this property.

    ///
    /// Every `EObject` knows its metaclass, which describes its structure including:
    /// - Attributes (data properties)
    /// - References (relationships to other objects)
    /// - Operations (behavioural methods)
    /// - Supertypes (inheritance hierarchy)

    ///
    /// This method provides dynamic access to the object's properties without
    /// requiring compile-time knowledge of the feature.

    /// - Returns: The feature's current value, or `nil` if not set.

    ///
    /// A feature is considered "set" if it has been assigned a value, even if that
    /// value equals the feature's default. This differs from checking if the value
    /// is `nil`, as unset features may have non-nil defaults.

/// conforming to ``EObject``. It tracks both the values themselves and which
/// features have been explicitly set.

/// ## Important
///
/// This is a helper type and does **not** conform to `EObject` itself.
/// It provides the storage mechanism for types that **do** conform to `EObject`.
///

/// - Maintains a separate set to track which features are explicitly set
/// - Supports value semantics through `Sendable`, `Equatable`, and `Hashable`
